"panda-css-workflows:panda-token-architecture"

This skill will help you design:
- Base tokens vs semantic tokens (two-layer system)
- Color palettes with numeric scales (0-100)
- Spacing, typography, and design token organization
- Theme-aware semantic tokens for light/dark modes
- Text styles and responsive token patterns
