description: Build a single React component with Panda CSS recipes, TypeScript, and accessibility patterns
---

Build ONE component at a time using Panda CSS implementation guidance.

**Usage:** `/panda-component <component-name>`

**Process:**
1. Identify the specific component to build
2. Implement using Panda CSS best practices:
   - Use Box component as polymorphic foundation (if needed)
   - Apply Panda CSS recipes for styling
   - TypeScript integration with Panda CSS
   - Accessibility patterns (ARIA, keyboard, focus)
   - Component composition strategies

**Important:** This command builds a SINGLE component only. If you need to build multiple components, run this command separately for each one.

Refer to the panda-component-impl instructions for detailed implementation patterns.
