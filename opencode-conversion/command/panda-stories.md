description: Create Storybook stories for a single Panda CSS component with variants and accessibility testing
---

Create Storybook stories for ONE component at a time using Panda CSS Storybook guidance.

**Usage:** `/panda-stories <component-name>`

**Process:**
1. Identify the specific component to document
2. Create comprehensive stories covering:
   - Component variants (all possible combinations)
   - Component props and usage patterns
   - Accessibility testing integration
   - Interactive controls for variant exploration
   - Responsive behavior demonstrations
   - Theme switching showcases

**Important:** This command creates stories for a SINGLE component only. If you need to create stories for multiple components, run this command separately for each one.

Refer to the panda-create-stories instructions for detailed story patterns.
