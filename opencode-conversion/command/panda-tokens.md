description: Design token architecture with base tokens, semantic tokens, and theme structures
---

Follow the Panda CSS token architecture guidance to design:
- Base tokens vs semantic tokens (two-layer system)
- Color palettes with numeric scales (0-100)
- Spacing, typography, and design token organization
- Theme-aware semantic tokens for light/dark modes
- Text styles and responsive token patterns

Refer to the panda-token-architecture instructions for detailed patterns.
