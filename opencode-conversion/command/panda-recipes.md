description: Create a single component recipe (regular or slot recipe) with variants and compound variants
---

Create ONE recipe at a time using Panda CSS recipe patterns.

**Usage:** `/panda-recipes <recipe-name>`

**Process:**
1. Identify the specific recipe to create
2. Determine recipe type:
   - Regular recipe for single-part components
   - Slot recipe for multi-part components (checkbox, tooltip, menu)
3. Define variants and compound variants
4. Apply recipe organization best practices
5. Validate recipe vs patterns vs inline CSS decision

**Important:** This command creates a SINGLE recipe only. If you need to create multiple recipes, run this command separately for each one.

Refer to the panda-recipe-patterns instructions for detailed guidance.
